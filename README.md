# HospitalReadmissions
Predictive Analytics for hospital Readmissions
Cost Reduction: Hospital readmissions are costly for healthcare systems. By identifying high-risk patients, hospitals can implement targeted interventions (e.g., follow-up care, patient education, or remote monitoring) to reduce readmission rates.

Improved Patient Outcomes: Early intervention can prevent complications and improve patient health, leading to better overall outcomes.

Regulatory Compliance: Many healthcare systems face penalties for high readmission rates under programs like the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) in the U.S. This project can help hospitals avoid such penalties.

Resource Optimization: Hospitals can allocate resources more efficiently by focusing on patients who need additional support post-discharge.
